// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
    room1 : {
      name: "FirstRoom",
      description: "This is the First Room",
      completed: "completed"},
     room2 : {
      name: "SecondRoom",
      description: "This is the Second Room",
      completed: "completed"},
     room3 : {
      name: "ThirdRoom",
      description: "This is the Third Room",
      completed: "completed"},
   }
